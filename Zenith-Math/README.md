This module is intended to wrap [Richard J. Mathar's](http://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/~mathar/) "[Java Math.BigDecimal Implementation of Core Mathematical Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3030v3)" library in order to provide it as a maven dependency.  Some additional features have been implemented such as caching so that we can avoid recomputing expensive math functions where possible.

The original code is licensed under (LGPL v3.0)[http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html] and the original package name has been preserved to keep it separate from the added features.
